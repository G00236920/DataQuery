# Go Problem Sheet 1

This project is based off a problem sheet we have been given by our lecturer for the purposes of learning the go language. 




**Getting Started**


To clone this repo to your machine



- Open terminal or command prompt

- cd to the Folder you wish to store the files 

- Type the command as follows:

	git clone https://github.com/G00236920/DataQuery

- using one of the programs as an example -HelloWordl.go

- Build using the command

	Go Build “HelloWorld.go”


- run the program




**List of Programs**


1. Kon’nichiwa, Sekai!

- Purpose - to create a program that will print Hello World in Japanese to the Console

- Goal - to show that the go lang can use many different languages



2. Current time

- Purpose - to create a program that produces the current time to the console

- Goal - to teach use how to call a function in the print line



3. FizzBuzz

- Purpose - Create a program that uses a loop and if statements to print the word “Fizz”, “Bizz” and “FizzBizz” depending on a modulus result.

- Goal - to teach us how to use loops and if statements



4. Factorial digit sum

- Purpose - create a program that shows the factorial value of an input

- Goal - I used this program to learn how recursion works in Go Language



5. Guessing game

- Purpose - Create a program that asks the user to input a number between 1 and 100, the tell the user if their guess was too high or too low

- Goal - I used this program to learn how to take user input and create random integer numbers. 


6. Largest and smallest in list

- Purpose - Create a program that creates a list that the user inputs and then determines the largest and smallest strings in the List.

- Goal - I used this program to learn how to create a list in go and compare strings by number or characters.



7. Palindrome test

- Purpose - Create a program that determines if a word entered by the user is a palindrome.

- Goal - I used this program to learn how to reverse a string and compare string values



8. Merge list and sort

- Purpose - To merge two sorted lists to one larger sorted list using a merge sort

- Goal -  I used this program to learn the merge sort and how to use arrays / slices



9. Newton’s method for square roots

- Purpose -  create a program that uses newtons method to determine the square root of a value.

- Goal - I used this program to learn how newtons square root method works



10. Reverse string

- Purpose - Create a program that reverses a string

- Goal - I pretty much used the palindrome program to recreate this program





**Versioning**

- Version 1.0 - I do not intend to make any changes to the code here
