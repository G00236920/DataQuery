# Go Problem Sheet 2

This project is based off a problem sheet we have been given by our lecturer for the purposes of learning the go language, while using curl and Web Applications 




**Getting Started**





**List of Progressions**


—Part 1—


	Objective: 

	Create a web application in Go that responds with the text “Guessing 	game”. 		This should be the response body irrespective of what request is received. 		Explain in your README how to examine the response, including the headers, using 	curl.
